# CSC380-Tower-Defense
## Information
This was a project attempt to create a Tower defense game in CSC380(a GUI design class studying 2D and 3D graphical practices). I attempted to create it from scratch other than a graphics resolution convert courtesy of my Professor, Blase Cindric, 

I plan on attempting to recreate this project to be more efficent that is higher quality in the near future to apply newer skills I have learned in development. 

## Controls
- Left click to place a tower for 20 gold. You can only place towers on non road based tiles.
- Left click to select a tower to see its stats.
- Left click a the upgrade button to upgrade the tower. There are infinite upgrade levels.
- If you left click and do not have enough money to buy a tower, or it is an invalid tile, it will display the tile information.

## Goal
 - Protect the base tile from being touched by the enemies by protecting it with towers place on the map. 
 
## Features
 -Tile Based Map system that allows for controlled placement of Towers
 - Upgrade System on towers
 - Progressively increasing difficulty of game that grows expontentially, as well as gold from the enemies
 - Health and Gold Based system.
 - Enemies have health bars.
 - Projectiles track enemies.

## Bugs
- Scaling does not work for right hand side of the screen due to the GUI setup.
- Enemies will progress to difficult in quantity if played too long and begin to lag the game due to the increasing number of enemies.
- Projectiles appear glitchly to the directional cordinates.
